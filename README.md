GoMate is a mobile-friendly travel companion app built using React Native (Expo).
The app helps users explore transportation routes across Sri Lanka, offering a clean and simple interface to view buses, trains, schedules, and availability.

The app displays a collection of routes — such as Colombo → Kandy or Galle → Jaffna — along with transport type, departure time, status, and a short description. Users can easily browse or search routes, making GoMate a lightweight and convenient journey planner.

This project includes:

A fully responsive UI built with React Native + Expo

A mock JSON dataset (mockTransport.json) for all routes

Local and online image handling for transport cards

Reusable components for cards, lists, and navigation

Clean folder structure for easy maintenance and scalability

GoMate is designed as a simple, fast, and intuitive solution for exploring intercity transport options.
